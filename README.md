# Onefootball iOS Assignment

The attached project contains a simple app to show football matches and news in a `UITableView`.

## Task:
Please read through the `ViewController.swift` file and highlight all issues (code styling, bugs, architectural problems) you encounter using comments.
The comments should contain concrete and detailed steps to fix the problem.
Please focus only on `ViewController.swift`.

## Notes about my solution

Please take in your consideration that I tried to highlight all issues and clarify solution steps without going into the details of the solution as much as possible  otherwise, I will have to write some code to clarify it and as you know there is no silver bullet solution as it depends on the problem in hand so and the tradeoffs so if you find anything unclear feel free to discuss it with me.

There are some recurring issues so I clarified them the first time and refered to them in other places.

Some problems is part of onther problem so I tried to refer it based on the it's context.
