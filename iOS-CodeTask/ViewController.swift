     - I recommend you to refactor data model so we can achieve separation of concerns as `ViewController` getting too much responsibilities (Massive ViewController) which makes it hard to test, extend, maintain and reuse also it's talking directly to model layer so I think we need an intermediate presentation layer to reduce `ViewController`'s responsibilities like `Presenter` if we go with `MVP` pattern or `ViewModel` in case of `MVVM` pattern it doesn't matter which pattern we will use as long as it achieves the required separation of concerns.
     - Also we need a way to manage dequeuing and configuring cell out of the `ViewController` as `ViewController` just need a list of presentable data model so I suggest we need to create `CellController` protocol with all the shared logic needed to render any type of cell something like `func cell(_ tableView: UITableView) -> UITableViewCell`
     1- Create two cellController classes `MatchCellController` and `NewsCellController` that implementing `CellController` and receive equivalent data model as dependency to configure the cell with it
     2- In `cell` function configure and return the equivalent cell `MatchCardTableViewCell` in `MatchCellController` and `NewsItemTableViewCell` for `NewsCellController`
     3- Add property instance of type `CellController` in `ViewController` and call `cell` function on that instance in `cellForRowAt` to return UITableViewCell
     4- You could create separate `Composition Layer` that responsible for instantiate other modules and handling relationships between modules so that in `Composition Layer` we can handle the logic related to appending and initializing `data` array of `ViewController` with different types of cells

         - I recommend you to apply dependency inversion principle to decouple `ViewController` from concrete API implementation, so instead of `ViewController` depends on concrete `MockMatchLoader` both of them depend on abstraction.
         1- Create protocol called `APIClient` with `loadItems(completion: @escaping (Result<[CellController], Error>) -> Void)` function.
         2- if we try to make `MockMatchLoader` implement `APIClient` directly we will face another issue `MockMatchLoader` is higher level than `ViewController` because it deals with high level operation agnostic of UI so it shouldn't depend on UI specific requirement `[CellController]` and in the same time we don't need `ViewController` to depend on concrete implementation details (e.g. `MockMatchLoader`or `NewsLoader`) directly so we need to adapt both unmatched interfaces to be able to decouple both of them and here is the role of `Adapter` pattern.
         3- Create `MatchAPIAdapter` that conforms to `APIClient` and add the required logic to map the array of `[Match]` into array of `[MatchCellController]` in `loadItems` function in the adapter .
         4- Inject instance of type `MockMatchLoader` into the adapter initializer to be able to call function `loadMatches` on it.
         5- Create `NewsAPIAdapter` that conforms to `APIClient` and add the required logic to map the array of `[NewsFeedItem]` into array of `NewsCellController` in `loadItems` function in the adapter.
         6- Inject instance of type `NewsLoader` into the `NewsAPIAdapter` initializer to be able to call function `loadNewsFeed` on it.
         7- Create instance property of type `APIClient` protocolÂ  into `ViewController` so API interface is injected into `ViewController` instead of let `ViewController` creating it, and this solution will give us two benefits:
         - Make `ViewController` more testable as it's easy now to replace the real network implementation with the mocking one.
         - Easy to change network implementation without affecting `ViewController` because it depends on abstraction not concrete implementation.
         7- Since the adapters considered a composition details we can move it to composition layer so we can inject the proper adapter into `ViewController` and so we are get rid of branching and if else.
